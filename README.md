## Features

- **Infinite Gameplay:** The game never ends in a draw; instead, it continues with a unique mechanic where moves cycle out of the grid.

- **Simple and Clean UI:** Focus on the game with a minimalist interface.

## How to Play

2. After the third move, the first move becomes faint.
3. On the fourth move, the first move is removed from the grid, allowing for continuous play.
4. The game continues indefinitely without a draw, challenging players to outmaneuver each other in an ongoing cycle.
